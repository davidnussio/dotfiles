# dotfiles

Configure machine

### Getting started
To start using my dotfiles on a new computer run the following:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidnussio/dotfiles/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Refs

This repo manages most of my dotfiles. GNU `stow` is used to manage the symlinks and installation.
